# Intro

Flint is a starting template to optimize your digital product building.
It's heavily opinionated and comes with several utilities and integration out of the box.

## Philosophy

Most of the time, you don't need to start from scratch.
Flint is designed to be a starting point for your digital product.
SaaS products for example, often share the same needs for authentication, database, storage, payments, analytics,etc.

But Flint is not just a scaffold, it's a set of utilities, integrations, and assets for the AI-aided development, that you can use as a workflow to build your digital products.

### AI-Assisted Development Done Right

Don’t buy into the hype that AI will perfectly build your product just because you ask it to. But if you step into the role of a product manager and treat AI like your developer, you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve.

Flint isn’t just a boilerplate. It’s a workflow, a set of resources, and prompts to help you leverage AI effectively in your product development.

### Integrations and third parties

All the choices are made so that the services and providers (with an obvious exception made for Stripe) are aligned with this pricinciples :

- Offer **free tiers** for starting projects
- Use **open-source technology**, with frameworks and libraries that are also open source
- Provide options to **self-host** solutions
- Are **widely used**, and **work great with AI**
